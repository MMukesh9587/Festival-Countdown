## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant gold (#FFD700), reminiscent of festive decorations and a feeling of celebration.
- Background color: Dark gray (#222222), to ensure readability and an elegant, modern look. 
- Accent color: Deep orange (#FF8C00), an analogous hue to the primary, should be used for interactive elements and highlights.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif, gives an elegant and high-end feel, suitable for the headings. Body text: 'PT Sans' complements it well.
- Use clear and recognizable icons for share, favorite, and settings options.
- Maintain a mobile-first, single-page layout for fast loading and ease of use. Use a grid or list to display multiple festivals, and dedicate a full page to individual festival countdowns.
- Incorporate subtle animations for countdown updates and transitions.
